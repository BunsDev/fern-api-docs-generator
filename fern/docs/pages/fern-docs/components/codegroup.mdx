title: Display code in tabs with CodeGroup
description: Use the CodeGroup component to show multiple code snippets in a tabbed view.
---

The `CodeGroup` component is used to display multiple code snippets in a tabbed view. It does not take any props.

Within the `CodeGroup` component, use [Markdown fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) along with a title and optional [syntax highlighting](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting). Please refer to Fern's [Code snippets](../content/code-snippets.mdx) guide for a full list of highlighting features.

<Note>
  The `CodeBlock` component (singular) is deprecated in favor of using Markdown fenced code blocks. The `CodeBlock`
  component was previously used to add a title to a fenced code block, but Fern now supports setting the title directly
  on the code block instead. If you used `CodeBlock` in your docs before, it will continue to work, but we recommend
  that you phase out its use.
</Note>

## Usage

<Warning>
  For fenced code blocks inside a `CodeGroup` component, be sure to set their `title` to give descriptive titles to the
  tabs. Otherwise, the tabs by default display `Untitled`.
</Warning>

Example:

````mdx
<CodeGroup>
  
```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool for a single project"
npm install fern-api
```

```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool globally"
npm install -g fern-api
```

</CodeGroup>
````

This renders as:

<CodeGroup>
  
```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool for a single project"
npm install fern-api
```

```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool globally"
npm install -g fern-api
```

</CodeGroup>
