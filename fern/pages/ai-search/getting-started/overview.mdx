Fern AI Search indexes your documentation and provides an interface for your users to ask questions and get answers. We've found that it helps our customers:

- **Decrease the time to find needed information** - Help users quickly locate crucial documentation without navigating through a maze of tabs and endpoints.
- **Integrate your product faster** - Accelerate implementation with ready-to-use code samples that demonstrate practical applications.
- **Surface where your docs have gaps** - Identify documentation weaknesses through user feedback and search patterns.

<Frame caption="Users can ask questions in natural language, and get answers in a conversational manner.">
