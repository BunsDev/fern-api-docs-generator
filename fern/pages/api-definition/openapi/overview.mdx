description: Bring your OpenAPI spec(s) and let Fern do the rest.

Fern supports reading [OpenAPI specs](https://www.openapis.org/) (up to and including version 3.1) to define APIs. If you
don't already have an OpenAPI, there are several ways of dynamically generating your OpenAPI spec.

## Generate a spec

<Info>
  The Fern team is currently working on a tool to help generate high-quality OpenAPI specs. If interested, please [reach
  out](mailto:support@buildwithfern.com).
</Info>

There are a wide variety of tools that you can use to generate an OpenAPI spec, however the quality of the spec produced varies.
Below we list a couple of tools that may be helpful

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="FastAPI (Python)">
    [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a server framework that automatically generates an OpenAPI spec for you.
    Once your server is running, you should be head to a `/openapi.json` to view and download your spec.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Zod to OpenAPI (TypeScript)">
    If you're already using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), the [Zod to
    OpenAPI](https://github.com/asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi) library can convert your Zod schema to a spec.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Swaggo (Go)">
    [Swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) handles converting Go annotations into Swagger 2.0 specs.

    <Note>Fern supports reading Swagger 2.0 specs so you don't have to worry about upgrading to 3.x</Note>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handwriting">
    For the best results, we recommend handwriting your OpenAPI spec. This will give you the ability to customize
    and finetune the OpenAPI spec wherever you want.

    <Info> If you find OpenAPI cumbersome to write, check out the [Fern Definition](learn/api-definition/fern/overview) instead. </Info>
