## Support for embedding local assets

We've added support for embedding local assets in your docs. This is useful for displaying PDFs, images, videos, and other assets into your docs.

To embed an asset, you can use the `embed` tag.

```mdx
<embed src="./path/to/asset.pdf" type="application/pdf" />
```
