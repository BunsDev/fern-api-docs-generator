## 1.10.00
**`(feat):`** Add support for generating dates. Configure the type of dates you generating using the `date-type` configuration option.
`date-type` has the following options:
- `use-date-only-portable` (default): Generates native `DateOnly` properties on .NET 6 and above, and falls back to using the third party `Portable.System.DateTimeOnly` package.
- `use-date-time`: Generates dates as `DateTime` properties.
- `use-date-only-on-net6+`: Generates native `DateOnly` properties on .NET 6 and above, and falls back to using `DateTime` on older versions of .NET.


**`(feat):`** Add test for serializing and deserializing date times.
