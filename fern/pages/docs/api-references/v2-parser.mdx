title: OpenAPI v2 parser
subtitle: The next generation of the OpenAPI Parser for Docs
---

The next generation of the OpenAPI parser was built explicitly for Fern Docs. It's designed to be more expressive, more flexible and enable faster feature
development.

Previously, the parser was passed through several lossy layers of transformation, resulting in less accurate representations of the OpenAPI specification.
From the ground up, it is built on top of the OpenAPI domain and was designed to directly converse to your docs to make sure that your experience with OpenAPI 
and fern docs is fast, seamless and enjoyable. To enable the new parser, you can set the following config in your `docs.yml` file:

```yaml
experimental:
  openapi-parser-v2: true
```

Features supported improving upon the current parser:
- Multiple success response examples
- Defaults, status codes, and schema specific metadata
- Null support in examples
- Higher fidelity parsing of OpenAPI files

Features coming soon:
- Support for No-Content responses
- Examples on each API reference 
- Multiple responses and content types
- Webhook query parameters
