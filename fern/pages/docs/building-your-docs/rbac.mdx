Fern allows role-based access restrictions for specific docs pages.

<Steps>

### Define roles

Define different roles in `docs.yml` by listing them under a `roles` key at the top level of indentation.

```yml docs.yml
roles:
  - everyone # every user is given this role
  - partners
  - admins
```

<Info>Every user is granted the `everyone` role.</Info>

{/* Waiting for confirmation from Deep. <Info>Every user is granted the `everyone` role, even if that role isn't explicitly defined under the `roles` key.</Info> */}


### Define viewers for documentation items

Every documentation item (including `section`, `page`, and `api references` components) can have a set of designated viewers.

Nested components inherit view permissions from their parent components. For example, if a section can only be viewed by users with the `admin` role, any child pages can also only be viewed by users with the `admin` role.

Navigation items without defined or inherited viewers are viewable by everyone.

```yml docs.yml {7-8} {14-16}
navigation:
  - tab: Documentation
    layout:
      - page: Overview
        path: pages/overview.mdx
      - section: Beta Release
        viewers:
          - beta-users
  - tab: API Reference
    layout:
      - page: Overview
        path: pages/overview.mdx
      - section: Administration
        viewers:
          - partners
          - admin
```


### Assign roles to users with `FERN_TOKEN` cookies

Users are assigned roles via a cookie called `FERN_TOKEN`.

The cookie must contain a JWT that is created for each user when they log in, using a secret key that Fern provides.

The JWT must have a `fern` claim with a key called `roles` that holds an array of the user's roles.


```json Sample JWT claim
{
  "fern": {
    "roles": ["partners", "admins"]
  }
}
```

When the a user tries to view a page with defined `viewers`, if the `FERN_TOKEN` cookie isn't present or doesn't contain a JWT with the appropriate role, the user is redirected to the company's login page.
