subtitle: "Host your docs on your own domain"

## Option 1: Subdomain (recommended)

To host your documentation on a subdomain, i.e. `docs.mydomain.com`, you need to create a CNAME record in your DNS settings.

<Steps>

### Create a CNAME record

1. Log in to your domain registrar's dashboard.
2. Navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.
3. Add a new CNAME record with the following details:
   - **Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Name**: `docs`
   - **Value**: `cname.vercel-dns.com.`

### Update the domain in docs.yml

```yaml
instances:
 - url: myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com
   custom-domain: docs.mydomain.com
```

Merge your changes into `main`.

### Reach out to us

Once you've completed the above steps, ask a member of the Fern team to complete the setup on our end.

If you have an existing project in Vercel, we may need you to verify our access to your subdomain via a TXT record, which we'll provide you with.

### Verify the setup

Once we've completed the setup on our end, you should be able to access your documentation at `docs.mydomain.com`. SSL will be automatically provisioned for your domain, but it may take a few minutes to propagate globally.

</Steps>

## Option 2: Subpath

To host your documentation on a subpath, i.e. `mydomain.com/docs`, you will need to setup a reverse proxy on your server (also known as rewrites). This is a more complex setup. If you need help setting up a reverse proxy, please reach out to a member of the Fern team. 

<Steps>

### Add rewrite rules to your server

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Next.js">

In your `next.config.js`, add the following rewrites:

```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/docs',
        destination: 'https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs',
      },
      {
        source: '/docs/:path*',
        destination: 'https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/:path*',
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Netlify">
In your `_redirects` file, add the following rules:

```txt
/docs https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs 200
/docs/* https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/:splat 200
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Cloudflare">

### Option 1: Origin Rules

If your Cloudflare account has access to Origin Rules (Enterprise), you can cheaply configure a reverse proxy using the following rule:

```txt

If...

When incoming requests match...

Custom filter expression: starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/docs")

Then...

Rewrite to: myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com

```

### Option 2: Cloudflare Workers

In your Cloudflare Worker script, add the following rule:

```js
const DOCS_URL = "myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs"


// do not modify below this line
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
    const docsUrl = new URL(`https://${DOCS_URL}`)
    const forwardedHost = url.hostname

  if (url.pathname.startsWith(docsUrl.pathname)) {
    // Rewrite the request URL to the new origin
    url.hostname = docsUrl.hostname

    // Make a new request using the modified URL
    const rewrittenRequest = new Request(url, request)
    rewrittenRequest.headers.set("Host", docsUrl.hostname)
    rewrittenRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", forwardedHost)
    rewrittenRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https")
    return fetch(rewrittenRequest)
  }
  
  return fetch(request)
}
```

Then, deploy your worker script to Cloudflare, and add a trigger to match the `/docs` path: `mydomain.com/docs/*`.

</Tab>

<Tab title="NGINX">

```
location /docs {
    rewrite ^/docs$ https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs permanent;
}

location ~ ^/docs/(.*) {
    rewrite ^/docs/(.*)$ https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/$1 permanent;
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Apache">

In `.htaccess`, add the following rules:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^docs$ https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs [R=301,L]
RewriteRule ^docs/(.*)$ https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/$1 [R=301,L]
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Express/Node.js">

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/docs', (req, res) => {
res.redirect(301, 'https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs');
});

app.get('/docs/:path', (req, res) => {
res.redirect(301, `https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/${req.params.path}`);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`));
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Django/Python">

Install the `django-shortcuts` package:
```shell
pip install django-shortcuts
```

Add the following views and URLs to your Django project:
```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def docs_redirect(request):
    return redirect('https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs', permanent=True)

def docs_path_redirect(request, path):
    return redirect(f'https://myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/{path}', permanent=True)


# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('docs', views.docs_redirect),
    path('docs/<str:path>', views.docs_path_redirect),
]

```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Update the domain in docs.yml

```yaml
instances:
 - url: myorg.docs.buildwithfern.com
   custom-domain: mydomain.com/docs
```

Merge your changes into `main`.

</Steps>

<Note>

Ideally, your reverse proxy should be as close to the origin as possible to minimize latency, such as on a CDN or a load balancer. If latency is a concern, please reach out to a member of the Fern team for guidance.

</Note>
